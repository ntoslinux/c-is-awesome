  New and Updated Features

   The following features are new (or have been significantly updated)
   since version 3.2.0:

     • Windows executables and installers are now signed using SHA-2
       only[1].

     • Save RTP stream to .au supports any codec with 8000 Hz rate
       supported by Wireshark (shown in RTP player). If save of audio is
       not possible (unsupported codec or rate), silence of same length
       is saved and warning is shown.

     • C-ares is now a required dependency.

     • Protobuf fields can be dissected as wireshark (header) fields
       that allows user input the full names of Protobuf fields or
       messages in Filter toolbar for searching.

     • Dissector based on Protobuf can register itself to a new
       'protobuf_field' dissector table, which is keyed with the full
       names of fields, for further parsing fields of BYETS or STRING
       type.

     • Wireshark is able to decode, play and save iLBC payload on
       platforms where iLBC library
       (https://github.com/TimothyGu/libilbc) is available.
